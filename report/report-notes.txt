--- Explain CCD
--- Explain root-changing (mention importance of data structures)
--- Explain conceptual idea of constraints
--- Explain constraint algorithm

- Results:
--- Converges on a solution very quickly in many circumstances
--- Doesn't automatically produce 'natural' poses (this would require modification of the algorithm to add extra

- Analysis/Conclusion:
--- Most IK algorithms (at least numerical algorithms) can be described in Hugo Elias's terms; N-dimensional space where N is the number of degrees of freedom; algorithms optimize some function that ranges over this space (usually distance-to-the-target-position, but it could be something else, e.g., like orientation of the end-effector).  This gives a framework for comparison/analysis of the algorithms.
--- CCD works by iterating over the N dimensions, immediately moving it to its closest minimum.
--- This is actually quite a nice algorithm - deceptively fast in many situations.  It's fastest

- Conclusions:
--- ???
